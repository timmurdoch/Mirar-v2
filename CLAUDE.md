Claude Project Instructions Code Quality Standards Documentation

Write clear, concise documentation that explains why decisions were made, not just what the code does Keep README files focused on essential information: setup, core concepts, and common workflows Document non-obvious behavior, edge cases, and architectural decisions Avoid over-documenting trivial code—let clear naming speak for itself

Code Comments

Use comments to explain intent and context, not mechanics Comment complex algorithms, business logic, and non-obvious optimizations Keep comments accurate—update them when code changes Prefer self-documenting code (clear names, small functions) over excessive comments Add TODO/FIXME comments with context when needed, but resolve them promptly

This File (claude.md)

Keep this file concise and actionable—it should be quick to scan Update it when project conventions or architecture evolve Remove outdated instructions immediately Focus on project-specific guidance that supplements general best practices

Maintainability Principles

Consistency over cleverness: Follow established patterns in the codebase Readability first: Code is read far more than it's written Small, focused changes: Keep commits and functions doing one thing well Test meaningful behavior: Write tests that verify business logic, not implementation details.
